# Sudoku-Puzzle-in-Java-Swing-AWT

Sudoku is a puzzle game which consists of 9 boxes. Each box is further divided into 9 small boxes.\ 

The small boxes are randomly filled with numbers from 1-9 in such a way that numbers are not repeated row wise, column wise or with respective to their box. \
When the new game starts, the numbers disappear in a random fashion and the player has to fill those boxes with the numbers from 1-9 in a non-repeated fashion.\
Except the empty boxes, the other prefilled small boxes are immutable. If the player repeats any number accidentally, small boxes containing the repeated number 
are filled with red color.
